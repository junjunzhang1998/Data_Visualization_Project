This portfolio showcases a collection of data visualizations created during my Fall 2024 semester at City College San Francisco. The visualizations are inspired by Edward Tufte’s principles, emphasizing clarity, simplicity, and truthful representation of data.

The portfolio includes projects that highlight different aspects of visualization design—from improving misleading graphics to creating impactful, narrative-driven visuals.

This portfolio reflects my ability to:
- Transform raw datasets into clear and compelling visuals.
- Identify misleading design choices and improve them.
- Combine technical programming skills with design aesthetics to communicate insights.
